In "An Overview of _The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_", author J. G. A. Pocock primarily discusses the famous work of Edward Gibbon, "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire". In analyzing Gibbon's work, Pocock pinpoints some inaccuracies and inconsistencies which can be considered as a direct criticism of this renowned historical piece. In my opinion, the grounds for Pocock's criticism is justified since he argues that Gibbon's analysis is not very accurate simply because of the lack of evidence, eyewitnesses, and textual material like books and manuscripts at his location during that time period. He further expands on this and tries to justify it by citing several examples from Gibbon's work where his historiography alters as he moves from one narrative to another. Also, Gibbon's work places a strong emphasis on the narrative of the history of religion, which dominates all other narratives, as Pocock makes clear in this article.


While reflecting on this article, I strongly feel that Pocock has a harsh (but somewhat valid) opinion on several of Gibbon's takes in his work. The mention of Gibbon's invalid arguments to support his explanations for the fall of the great Roman Empire, the lack of comprehensiveness and context between several chapters, and his controversial opinions about Christianity as an agent in the disintegration of the empire all are Gibbon's takes which many present historians and scholars do not particularly agree with, and Pocock magnifies this sentiment in this article.

Since this class is introducing us to the world of Digital Humanities, I couldn't stop but think about the role that Digital Humanities might have in studying historical events had historians and researchers had access to it earlier. Many of Pocock's arguments on Gibbon's inconsistencies and lack of context would not stand, and I would definitely not be writing a blog post about it! 

Humor aside, reading Pocock's analysis of Gibbon's work also made me wonder about how our history (and historiography) might be meddled with inaccuracies and inconsistencies solely due to it being passed on from one generation to another by word of mouth and cultural practices. Likewise, will this same trend be observed while people read our history 1000 years from now, now that digital humanities is rampant? Can the advancement of technology prevent inconsistent historical descriptions, or will it lead to more inconsistencies? These are all powerful questions that only time has the power to answer, and I'm afraid we will not be around to see how that answer will be formulated.
