## Reflection
TODO

As I started reading the Programming Historian Lesson, I noticed that this lesson did not actually create keywords in context from n-grams but instead only focused on extracting all possible n-grams from a body of text. To also get the KWICs from the n-grams generated, I went ahead and followed the next [lesson](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/output-keywords-in-context-in-html-file) on creating Keywords in Context from an n-gram dictionary. Therefore, this reflection is a representation of a mixture of both these lessons.
